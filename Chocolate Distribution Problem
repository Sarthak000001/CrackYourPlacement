Question: 
The problem is an easy level in problem we have given an array A of packets with A[i] chocolate and another interger 'M' and we have to distribute chocolate among 'M' student following condition.
1. Each students get's exact one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.

Code:
```
class Solution{
    public:
    long long findMinDiff(vector<long long> a, long long n, long long m){
        // simply sort the array and iterate it in 'M' sized subarray and 
        // find the difference of (max number) and (min number) and store minimum
        // difference among all the M subarray slides
        sort(a.begin(),a.end());
        long long ans = INT_MAX;
        long long low = 0;
        long long high = m-1;
        while(high < n){
            ans = min(a[high]-a[low],ans);
            high++;
            low++;
        }
        return ans;
    }   
};
```
